    "Fragments may represent conformers can be *complete*, which we define as being seen in more than one PDB;\n",
    "or they may be *singletons*, which we define as being seen in only one PDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completeness can be determined at any precision (an RMSD distance in A). \n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious way is to determine for each fragment the closest fitting fragment (from a different PDB),\n",
    "and then to determine which percentage of those closest fitting fragments is within the precision distance.\n",
    "This is however somewhat computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show that fragment completeness at distance X can be determined directly from analysis of the clustering at X (for X=0.5A or X=1A). This analysis is trivial in terms of computation time. For ~99.8 % of the fragments, they can be designation as complete or singleton with certaintly. For the remaining ~0.2 %, the designation is putative, but still correct in the large majority of cases."
