Builds library from nondredundant fragments generated by nucleotide-fragment-pipeline

- clust.sh  (or equivalent script with parallel cluster jobs)
- clust-origin.sh
- build-library.sh  (or equivalent script with parallel cluster jobs)
Optional, for completeness analysis:
- closest-fit.sh  (or equivalent script with parallel cluster jobs)

Note that the generated libraries are only for A/C.
To extend to A/C/G/U, lib-mutate.py must be run (which requires mutate.py)

For closest-fit.py, there is another version in context-specific/, allowing a specific Pfam or Rfam.
    - TODO: Needs some file location adaptation
    - Note: needs to run convert-original.py
